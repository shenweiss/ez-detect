 Ez_detect_batch.m
 
 v3: Added asymmetric GPU filtering, made adjustments to
 time annotations in the DSP to account for phase delay.

 v4: 1)Added entropy measures to remove noisy electrodes. 
     2)Added correction for skew of BP filtered distributions. 
     3) Removed line noise and otherwise noisy channels using GPU autocorrelation function. 
     4) Impedence check (60 cycles) using GPU FFT.

 v5: 1)Implement in engine #1/#2 
     2)Change ez_detect loops to one minute from 20 seconds
     3)Remove annotation writing from ez_detect 
     4) add new GPU ez_top. 
     5) remove transient events after ez_top. 
     6) write TRC annotations after ez_top. 
     7) mongoDB functions to upload ez_pac results and add metadata.

 v7: 1)Added nnetwork to find bad channels 
     2)Added nnetwork to find bad channels on the basis of captured ripple events. 
     3)Added nnetwork to find bad channels on the basis of captured fripple events.
