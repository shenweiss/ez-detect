System Requirements: A Windows 7 or above system running Brain Quick version 1. This plug-in has not yet been tested with the yet to be released Brain Quick version 2. A second system running Linux (tested on Ubuntu 20), with an NVIDIA GPU, that performs the data processing. On the Linux system, at least 64 GB of RAM is required, although over 100 GB of RAM is recommended. A swapdisk for vistual memory of at least 10GB is recommended. Linux software requirements include Matlab 2017a or later, Python 3.5.2 and Anaconda 3 4.2 or above. Other dependencies are stated below in the instructions or will be installed automatically. Note that it may be possible to use the MCR instead of purchasing Matlab, but MCR has a different architecture for running Matlab within Python and the code will need to be modififed. 

** A note about Anaconda ***
Errors were encountered in building the software using the latest version of Conda 4.11 which uses Python 3.9. The software was successfully built using Conda 4.10.3 and Python 3.8. In your virtual environment for the project you do not need to import Anaconda. 

** A note about Anaconda virtual environments **
Before installing your software it is recommended to create a new environment or copy your existing environment to the project directory. If you are using opt/conda as the virtual environment the project will not operate correctly. You need to use conda activate venv to activate your environment.

Description of software: HFO-Engine consists of the HFO-Engine plug-in client for Micromed Brainquick that operates on Windows 7 or above, and a HFO-Engine webserver that interfaces with the HFO-Engine plug-in client and operates in Linux. The HFO-Engine client in Windows can be executed within Brainquick or as a stand alone. The HFO Engine webserver on the Linux system, that receives commands from HFO-engine client, interfaces with EZ-detect (the HFO detector) which also operates in Linux.  Installation of this package requires a moderate-advanced proficiency in Linux and familiarity with Python and also Matlab.

For further information please see the HFO-Engine User’s manual.

Windows installation instructions:
- In https://github.com/shenweiss/ From the HFO_engine repository on the master branch in the bundles folder download HFO_engine_V_0.0.2.rar
- unrar the files in the BQ_plugin_driver_dlls folder to the Micromed/BrainQuick/Plugins directory
- create a folder hfo_engine in the Plugins directory
- unrar the files in the hfo_engine folder to the ~/Plugins/hfo_engine directory
- copy the CommandLine.dll file in the ~/Plugins/hfo_engine directory to the ~/Plugins directory

* Trouble shooting:
1) make sure all the files in the plugins directory and subdirectory are unblocked in Windows by clicking on file properties. If the files are marked as blocked it will result in a .NET framework error within Brain Quick.
2) make sure your user has access to the windows98 directory on your local drive and all subdirectories including temp.

* Trouble shooting:
1) This project has many dependencies, some of the dependencies may need to be upgraded or downgraded depending on the current version to execute the project. Please look carefully at error messages when installing each package or installing the dependencies. Instructions for upgrading and downgrading each dependency can be found online using Google searches.
2) If a connection cannot be established between the HFO_engine.exe client on Windows and the web_server on Linux it may be due to a firewall on either system. Be sure the port (8080) is open to incoming and outgoing traffic on both systems. To check that the webserver is operational on the host try

$ python3
Python 3.5.2 (default, Apr 16 2020, 17:47:17)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import requests
>>> response = requests.get('http://')
>>> response
<Response [200]>
>>> response.text
'{"message":"Welcome to FastWaveLLC HFO engine"}\n'

To check that you can connect to the server from the client’s computer open a web browser and go to 
http://server's ip address:8080/ 
you should see the Fastwave welcome message

Note: This package was intended for the server to run in the cloud. Other configuration options are possible including setting up a Windows guest VM on a Linux host. In this case, a bridged network configuration is recommended for the Windows VM. It may also be possible to install HFO-Engine/EZ-Detect on Windows

3. make sure permissions are set to allow your user to read, write, execute

v1.0.0 can be downloaded from http://gitlab.liaa.dc.uba.ar/tju-uba (currently down)

v1.0.1 Modifications Notes: While some of these modifications were make to make the software more user friendly (i.e. case sensitivity, etc), others detracted from the original design. In python 3.8.11 the path/paths defined in the program were not operating correctly within Python or Matlab. This required manually entering the paths in to the code. If an advanced Python programmer would like address this issue please let me know. For now in version v0.0.1 the paths must be entered in the appropriate sections of the Matlab and Python code. 

v1.0.1 Modifications include:
------------------------
- in HFO-Engine requirements updated Werkzeug to 0.15.5
- in EZ-Detect requirements updated mne to 0.23.4
- in engine.py added line 53 to accept lower case EDF
- in io.py in trcio hacked rec_time error in lines 544-550 due to datetime incompatibility and deidentify the data
- in converter.py added lines 139-134 to differentiate EDF files stored in uV vs. Volts 
- added debug comments in analyzer.py and indent after try to allow user to see error messages from the Flask server
- in analyzer.py simplified call to hfo_annotate 
- io_trc/io.py modified line 956 with open(self._filenames[0]) as fid: likely due to MNE version upgrade
- in hfo_annotate altered start_time code to account for time zone conversion. It should work worldwide and adjust to daylight savings time
- in hfo_annotate hardcoded cycletime to 600 seconds.
- in removeEvents_1_5_cycles.m converted RonS and fRonS that did not meet duration criteria to FronS. 
- in ez_detect_dsp_bipolar.m added lines 24-28 for bipolar only detection mode
- in hfo_annotate.py made a number of changes to eliminate threading due to Matlab bug related to saving data on each thread, the original version including threads is saved as hfo_annotate_threads.py
- in hfo_annotate.py and ez_bad_channel_temp.m and preprocessing.py made several changes relating to building correct montages in Matlab related to translation of a Python object structure.
- in eztop_putou_e1.m added metadata to the saved data to correct for error in writing annotations of multiple blocks
- in evtio/io.py added code to allow for correct annotations of multiple blocks of data

v1.0.1 Beta Testing
----------------------
- Nihon Kohden amplifier EDF data
- Natus Quantum amplifier EDF data
- Micromed Native TRC data
- New installation from shenweiss github repositories onto Google Cloud instance, tested installation twice. Note for Cloud deployment most services have http tranfer limit of 35 MB, thus to deploy the software to the cloud using a commercial platform you will need to make modifications at the client and server side to overcome the limitation in file size. 

Benchmarks
-------------------
- A 10 minute block of data will require between 25-120 minutes, if analyzed in referential mode. The actual time depends on the number of channels and the number of HFOs detected.
- A 10 minute block of data will require between 15-90 minutes, if analyzed in bipolar mode. The actual time depends on the number of channels and the number of HFOs detected.
